        Coronavirus essay in English - Corona Virus which is commonly known as COVID-19 is an infectious disease that causes illness in the respiratory system in humans. The term Covid 19 is sort of an acronym, derived from “Novel Corona Virus Disease 2019”. Corona Virus has affected our day to day life. This pandemic has affected millions of peoples, who are either sick or are being killed due to the spread of this disease.

        COVID-19 is a new virus that is impacting the whole world badly as it is spreading primarily through contact with the person. It is spread from person to person among those in close contact within 6 feet. Most of the countries have slowed down their manufacturing of the products.

<body><h3>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in humans. They are called “corona” because of crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are examples of coronaviruses that cause illness in humans.

    The new strain of coronavirus — SARS-CoV-2 — was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has since spread to every country around the world.</h3>
<h2  style="color: black;"></h1>Overview</h1> 



    <p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China.

        The virus is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.
        
        Public health groups, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO, are monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and posting updates on their websites. These groups have also issued recommendations for preventing and treating the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>

<b></h2>Symptoms of Covid-19</b></h2>
<p>COVID-19 symptoms vary from person to person. In fact, some infected people don’t develop any symptoms (asymptomatic). In general, people with COVID-19 report some of the following symptoms:

    Fever or chills.
    Cough.
    Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
    Tiredness.
    Muscle or body aches.
    Headaches.
    New loss of taste or smell.

    Nausea or vomiting.
    Diarrhea.</p>

        <br><b>Austria</b>
        While face masks are no longer required in most parts of the country, you must still wear a FFP2 face mask on public transport and in pharmacies in Vienna.

            One issue is how prepared the world's health systems are to respond to an outbreak of this scale. It's clear the large number of cases of COVID-19 is testing the health system in China. Yet, China was able to build a hospital for affected patients in a matter of days. No other country could mobilise resources and manpower at such speed. While health systems in high-income countries would be stretched by the outbreak, the most devastating effects would be in countries with weak health systems, ongoing conflicts, or existing infectious disease epidemics. In these countries, it is imperative to rapidly detect and contain the virus at points of entry to prevent community transmission and health systems from being overwhelmed. Health authorities in Africa are on high alert for the virus, given the continent's extensive trade and transport links with Asia. The capacity in Africa to screen, isolate, and treat patients and perform contact tracing is being built under the leadership of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO.
            As in all outbreaks, there is an urgent need to develop effective diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Several experimental diagnostic platforms are already in use in China and elsewhere. The whole-genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 had been obtained and shared widely by mid-January, a feat not possible at such speed in previous infectious disease outbreaks. This sequence will allow fine-tuning of existing technologies and development of better diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. Several potential treatments have been proposed, including a Janus kinase inibitor known as baricitinib. However, no antiviral treatment has been approved for coronaviruses, and despite two outbreaks of novel coronaviruses in the past two decades, vaccine development is still in its infancy. WHO has announced that a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 should be available in 18 months, but achieving this will require funding and public interest to be maintained even if the threat level falls.
